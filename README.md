# Indian Startup Funding Analysis (2020–2025) 💰
**My First Data Project – Built from Scratch in Google Sheets**

I didn't just download a dataset and make a few charts.  
I dug into **real Indian startup funding data** (2020–2025 sample, ~1,100 rounds, ~$28 Billion USD total), cleaned messy dates like a pro, built **four targeted pivot tables + professional charts**, and turned raw numbers into actionable stories that actually matter in Bengaluru's startup scene.

This isn't a school assignment — it's me **proving I can spot trends recruiters care about**: which stages get the big money, which cities dominate, which sectors are eating the funding pie, and how the ecosystem evolved through boom, winter, and recovery.

### What I Actually Built & Why It Matters
- **Cleaned & Transformed Raw Data**  
  Split DD-MM-YYYY dates into Day/Month/Year columns → enabled accurate time-based grouping without formula headaches.

- **Funding by Investment Stage** (the money shot)  
  Pivot + column chart showing total $ poured into each stage.  
  **Key flex:** Series C, Growth & Series D stages captured the lion's share (~70% of total funding) while Seed had 353 deals but tiny average checks.  
  → Clear signal: Investors love betting big once traction is proven — exactly where data analysts shine in scaling companies.

- **Top Cities by Total Funding**  
  Bar chart highlighting city-level dominance.  
  **Bengaluru pride moment:** Even with epic traffic and filter coffee addiction, we're punching hard in the top tier. Pune & Delhi led volume in this sample, but local Mobility/EdTech/AgriTech wins keep showing up.

- **Top Industries by Funding**  
  Ranked bar chart exposing who’s really getting the cash.  
  FoodTech, E-commerce, FinTech & Consumer Electronics are feasting — because India literally runs on delivery apps, online shopping and digital money.

- **Funding Trend by Year**  
  Line/column chart tracking the rollercoaster: 2021–2022 boom → 2023 winter dip → clear 2024–2025 recovery signals.  
  → Post-winter realism is here, but the ecosystem is alive and funding is flowing again.

**Total funding captured in this analysis: ~$28 Billion USD**  
That's not pocket change — it's proof India's startup engine is still one of the world's hottest.

### Why This Project Stands Out
- 100% self-taught execution in Google Sheets (no Python yet — keeping it accessible & fast)  
- Focused on **business-relevant questions** instead of generic Titanic-style EDA  
- Added real storytelling + light Bengaluru personality (because data without context is boring)  
- Designed for recruiters: quick-scan visuals, clear insights, local relevance  
- First public portfolio piece as an aspiring **Data Analyst → Data Scientist** living in India's startup capital

### Tech Stack (Simple but Effective)
- Google Sheets  
- Pivot Tables (4 custom-built)  
- Built-in Charts (polished with custom formatting, sorted descending, readable billions-scale axis)  
- Manual date parsing & cleaning

### Next Level (Already Planned)
- Move this to Python/Pandas + Seaborn/Plotly for interactivity  
- Add averages, correlations, top investors breakdown  
- Build a mini dashboard in Looker Studio or Streamlit
